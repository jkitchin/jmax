instead.

reload the named file instead of the buffer's file.  The file may be
saved based on the value of `py-execute-import-or-reload-save-p'.

See also `M-x py-execute-region'.

This may be preferable to `M-x py-execute-buffer' because:

 - Definitions stay in their module rather than appearing at top
