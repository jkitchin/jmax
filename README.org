#+TITLE: jmax - John's customizations to maximize Emacs

Try it you might like it. These customizations have been compiled and derived from prelude and the emacs24-starterkit, and my own emacs hackery.

To install this, clone the git repository, change into the jmax directory, and run this command:
#+begin_src sh
emacs -q -l init.el
#+end_src

This will load the emacs on your path, without using whatever you have defined in .emacs.d.

The first time you run this, a lot of packages will be downloaded into the elpa folder. This takes a few minutes. You might have to restart emacs.

I run a pretty modern org-mode. You should clone the org-mode repository, and run the make command to build the autoloads. I usually use =make up2= which updates the git repository. Here is what I do inside the jmax directory. 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone git://orgmode.org/org-mode.git
cd org-mode
make autoloads
#+END_SRC

That is it. If you like this, you may want to create some kind of shortcut or alias that automatically loads jmax when you open emacs.

* Customization
These files contain variables with paths specific to your computer. You probably need to change them.

To set the variables for our org-bibliography functionality you can run:
M-x customize-group jorg-bib

As an alternative, put these variables into a .el file in the user directory. You will want to modify them for your needs of course.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq reftex-default-bibliography '("~/Dropbox/bibliography/references.bib"))

;; see jorg-bib.el for use of these variables
(setq jorg-bib-bibliography-notes "~/Dropbox/bibliography/notes.org"
      jorg-bib-default-bibliography '("~/Dropbox/bibliography/references.bib")
      jorg-bib-pdf-directory "~/Dropbox/bibliography/bibtex-pdfs/")

;;Tell the program who you are and setup for email
(setq user-full-name "John Kitchin"
      andrewid "jkitchin"
      user-mail-address "jkitchin@andrew.cmu.edu"
      ;; specify how email is sent
      send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it
      ;; used in message mode
      message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it
      smtpmail-smtp-server "smtp.andrew.cmu.edu"
      smtpmail-smtp-service 587)

#+END_SRC

* Project goal
=jmax= is a customized version of emacs to facilitate authoring and consuming org-mode based technical documents.

All of the emacs customization is performed in an org-mode file.
