;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library provides code to convert an org-file into a nearly
;; standalone zip file. Any files linked to in the org-file will be
;; copied into the zip file, and the link to the file modified to
;; point to the new file.
;;
;; (ox-archive-create-zip) will create a zip file with the basename of
;; the org-file and the tag provided.
;;  
;; (ox-archive-create-and-mail) creates the zip file and attaches it
;; to an email.
;;
;; This is very slow on windows. I am not sure why. It is blazing fast
;; on Linux.
