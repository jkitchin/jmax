                  on Ag(111) and Ag(110) surfaces by dosing with NO2
                  between 500-520 K in UHV. These were studied using
                  TPD, LEED, XPS, HREELS, AES and NRA. The high
                  coverage atomic oxygen structures, Ag(111)-(4 x 4)O
                  and Ag(110)-c(6 X 2)O are easily formed in UHV using
                  moderate dosing pressures. The spectroscopic data
                  indicate that these NO2-produced overlayers have the
                  same structure as those produced using oxygen at
                  high pressures. The absolute coverage of the
                  Ag(111)-(4 x 4)O is determined to be 7.07(+/-0.55) X
                  10(14) O atoms cm(-2) or 0.51 +/- 0.04 ML. This
                  state is characterized by a single O 1s XPS peak at
                  528.2 eV. The NO2-produced Ag(111)-(4 X 4)O
                  structure is suggested to be composed of two
                  parts. The outer layer of this phase is composed of
                  a coincidence mesh of a single layer of the (111)
                  plane of Ag2O, which itself is comprised of a Ag
                  plane sandwiched between two oxygen planes. Between
                  this coincidence mesh and the Ag(111) surface is a
                  partial monolayer of chemisorbed oxygen atoms. The
                  c(6 X 2)O structure is characterized by two
                  vibrational loss peaks at 298 and 339 cm(-1), a
                  single O 1s XPS peak at 528.5 eV, and a coverage of

  Abstract =	 {{A number of elementary reactions at metal surfaces
                  show a linear Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi relation
                  between the activation energy and the reaction
                  energy, and reactions belonging to the same class
                  even follow the same relation. We investigate the
                  implications of this finding on the kinetics of
                  surface-catalyzed chemical processes. We focus in
                  particular on the variation in the activity from one
                  metal to the next.  By analyzing a number of simple
                  microkinetic models we show that the reaction rate
                  under given reaction conditions shows a maximum as a
                  function of the dissociative adsorption energy of
                  the key reactant, and that for most conditions this
                  maximum is in the same range of reaction
                  energies. We also provide a database of
                  chemisorption energies calculated using
                  density-functional theory for a number of simple gas
                  molecules on 13 different transition metals. An
                  important part of the analysis consists of
                  developing a general framework for analyzing the
                  maximum rate. We use these concepts to rationalize
                  trends in the catalytic activity of a number of
                  metals for the methanation process.  (C) 2004
