                  rest to a large extent on the experimentally
                  assessed phase diagrams. Long ago, it was assumed
                  that in the Cu–Pd system for x Pd ≤25\% there are at
                  least two phases at high temperature (L1 2 and a L1
                  2 -based superstructure), which evolve into a single
                  L1 2 -ordered phase at low temperature. By
                  constructing a first-principles Hamiltonian, we
                  predict a yet undiscovered Cu 7 Pd ground state at x
                  Pd = 12.5\% (referred to as S1 below) and an L1 2
                  -like Cu 9 Pd 3 superstructure at 25\% (referred to
                  as S2). We find that in the low-temperature regime,
                  a single L1 2 phase cannot be stable, even with the
                  addition of anti-sites. Instead we find that an
                  S2-phase with S1-like ordering tendency will
                  form. Previous short-range order diffraction data

                  important consequences for both their material
                  properties and their chemical reactivity. In this
                  study, the initial stages of alloying of Pd and Ag
                  with Cu(111) are compared. Low-temperature scanning
                  tunneling microscopy reveals that physical vapor
                  deposition of Pd and Ag at or above room temperature
                  yields remarkably different surface alloys: Pd
                  predominantly incorporates at the nearest ascending
                  Cu step edge, whereas Ag appears to be able to
                  traverse step edges rather easily and alloys into
                  terraces both above and below its initial adsorption
                  site. Density functional theory calculations reveal
                  that even though Pd adatoms have a lower barrier
                  than Ag for traversing step edges, unlike Ag they
                  bind very strongly to ascending step edges and
                  remain there permanently. This leads to a situation
                  in which Pd atoms have at most a very small number
                  of attempts to leave the terrace on which they are
                  deposited before they are incorporated into the
                  nearest ascending step edge. Ag adatoms, however,
                  have many opportunities to cross step edges and can
                  alloy at positions far from their initial starting
                  point. This direct comparison demonstrates the
                  importance in combining theory and experiment in
                  order to understand complicated surface alloying
                  mechanisms and illustrates how both the kinetics and
                  the thermodynamics of the process must be considered
                  to fully understand experimental observations.}},

                  half-period M varies not only with composition but
                  also with temperature. A systematic decrease in M
                  with increasing temperature has been established. At
                  low Pd concentrations the M values are

                  imaging. At high Pd concentrations, M decreases and
                  locks in at simple commensurate values such as 4·5,

                  existence of a region in which one-dimensional long
                  period superstructures are stable. This region is
                  composed of several single phase fields in which the

                  with results from High Resolution Electron

                  boundaries at low Pd concentration to sharp
                  antiphase boundaries at high Pd concentration is
                  related to a significant change of the interactions
                  with Pd concentration. The role of the Fermi surface

                  well-known approach to predicting multicomponent

                  experimental or simulation data for single-component
                  adsorption. A limitation in practical applications
                  of IAST is that useful calculations often require
                  extrapolation of fitted single-component isotherms
                  beyond the range for which data are available. We
                  introduce a molecular simulation approach in which
                  the intrinsic accuracy of IAST can be examined in a
                  context that avoids any need to perform curve
                  fitting with single-component data. Our approach is
                  based on using transition matrix Monte Carlo to
                  define single-component adsorption isotherms for
                  arbitrary bulk-phase pressures from a single
                  simulation. We apply our approach to several light

                  classes of systems, characterized by the sign of the

                  economically, novel separation processes that
                  produce high-purity H2 must be developed. While
                  binary palladium based alloys have shown promising
                  pure hydrogen flux values, the search for optimal
                  binary or ternary alloys is an involved and costly
                  process due to the immense number of alloy
                  variations that can be prepared and tested. In this
                  paper an approach to identify, fabricate, and
                  experimentally verify the hydrogen permeation
                  performance of PdCu and PdAu binary alloys and
                  ternary alloys of PdCuAu at various copper and gold

                  hydrogen selective free-standing membranes is
                  reported. This approach utilizes three primary tasks
                  of (1) materials modeling and composition selection,
                  (2) fabrication of high-performance binary and
                  ternary alloy membranes, and (3) membrane testing
                  and evaluation that are all operating independently
                  and concurrently. For the binary Pd?Cu system, using
                  a pure Pd membrane as the reference, both the
                  theoretically predicted and experimentally measured
                  additions of copper lowered the hydrogen
                  permeability. For the binary Pd?Au system, the

                  the theoretical model but in the experimental
                  testing was enhanced. For the ternary system, both
                  experimental and theoretical permeabilities were

                  reducing the permeability.}},

                  methods to disordered alloys is to make quantitative
                  predictions for the net solubility and diffusivity
                  of interstitial H based on the spatially local
                  information that can be obtained from
                  first-principles calculations. In this study, we
                  used a combination of density functional theory
                  calculations and a cluster expansion method to
                  describe interstitial H in alloys of composition

                  investigations of multicomponent materials such as
                  alloys, A x B y C1− x − y . CSAFs are prepared such
                  that the alloy film has a lateral spatial gradient
                  in its local composition; thus, they include a set
                  of alloy samples with a distribution of compositions
                  that spans a continuous region of composition space
                  (x,y). A tool based on the shadow mask concept has
                  been developed for generating composition gradients,
                  but modified to allow rotation of the shadow mask
                  during CSAF deposition. The tool allows deposition
                  of CSAFs containing up to four elements with
                  rotatable shadow masks between each of the four
                  electron beam evaporation sources and the deposition
                  substrate. This allows codeposition of any
                  combination of up to four components. In the case of
                  the ternary A x B y C1− x − y CSAFs, the three
                  components can be deposited such that the resulting
                  CSAF spans the entire ternary alloy composition
                  space (x = 0 → 1, y = 0 → 1 − x) and, furthermore,
                  contains all three binary alloys A x B1− x , A x C1−
                  x , and B x C1− x (x = 0 → 1) and all three pure
                  components. The innovation of the rotatable shadow
                  masks also allows preparation of CSAFs that magnify
                  selected regions of the composition space (x = x min
                  → x max, y = y min → 1 − x). Herein, we describe the

                  Cu(111) surface doped by a small amount of Pd atoms
                  can exhibit excellent catalytic performance toward
                  the dissociation of H2 molecules. Here we performed
                  systematic first-principles calculations to
                  investigate the corresponding mechanism. Our results
                  clearly demonstrate that a very small number of Pd
                  atoms in the subsurface layer can effectively reduce
                  the energy barrier of H2 dissociation, making the
                  ensembles composed of the surface and contiguous
                  subsurface Pd atoms as the active sites. The
                  catalytic activity can be further improved if the Pd
                  atoms are doped in the stepped Cu surfaces. The
                  impact of the subsurface Pd atoms comes from an

                  adjusting the electronic structure of the

                  finely tune the surface activity by a very limited

                  to find systems suitable for H2 storage
                  applications. Standard methods for this task
                  efficiently identify the lowest energy reaction
                  mechanisms among all possible reactions involving
                  collections of materials for which DFT calculations
                  have been performed. The resulting mechanism can
                  potentially differ from physical reality due to
                  inaccuracies in the DFT functionals used, or due to
                  other approximations made in estimating reaction
                  free energies. We introduce an efficient method to
                  probe the robustness of DFT-based predictions that
                  relies on identifying reactions that are metastable

                  wide range of oxygen adsorption energies on the

                  binding that is stronger than on a Pd(111) surface
                  and weaker than that on a Ag(111) surface. This and

                  (DFT) calculations have proven to be a useful
                  complement to experimental efforts to characterize
                  permeation of hydrogen through metal membranes at
                  elevated temperatures. Previous applications of this
                  approach have focused on relatively small numbers of
                  alloys with specific binary or ternary
                  compositions. We describe DFT-based calculations
                  that provide predictions for the solubility,
                  diffusivity, and permeability of hydrogen at
                  elevated temperatures in PdCuAg alloys for a wide
                  range of compositions of this ternary alloy that
                  yield substitutionally disordered fcc materials. Our
                  results show that the variation in permeability of
                  hydrogen among these alloys is more closely tied to
                  variations in solubility than variations in
                  diffusivity. These results give a detailed
                  description of a ternary alloy of practical interest
                  for high temperature H2 purification and also
                  demonstrate a general strategy for making
                  predictions about complex metal alloys for this
                  application. \^{a}º Density Functional Theory

                  spectroscopy (XPS). Preferential segregation of Cu
                  to the top-surface of the S/CuxPd1 − x CSAF was
                  observed at all bulk compositions, x, but the extent
                  of Cu segregation to the S/CuxPd1 − x surface was
                  lower than the Cu segregation to the surface of a
                  clean CuxPd1 − x CSAF, clear evidence of an
                  S-induced ” segregation reversal.” The
                  Langmuir–McLean formulation of the Gibbs isotherm
                  was used to estimate the enthalpy and entropy of Cu
                  segregation to the top-surface, \^{I}Hseg(x) and
                  \^{I}Sseg(x), at saturation sulfur coverages. While
                  Cu segregation to the top-surface of the clean
                  CuxPd1 − x is exothermic (\^{I}Hseg < 0) for all

                  (\^{I}Hseg > 0) for S/CuxPd1 − x. Segregation to the
                  S/CuxPd1 − x surface is driven by entropy. Changes
                  in segregation patterns that occur upon adsorption
                  of S onto CuxPd1 − x appear to be related to
                  formation of energetically favored PdS bonds at the
                  surface, which counterbalance the enthalpic driving

                  valid for hydrides that are stable at high

                  and NaH with four levels of theory. We also
                  investigate isotope effects to understand if these
                  should be accounted for in screening of deuterated

  abstract =	 {{PdCu alloy membranes are promising candidates for
                  hydrogen separation from H2S-containing gas
                  mixtures. Dissociative H2 adsorption and associative
                  desorption are important steps in the process of
                  hydrogen transport across PdCu membranes; however,
                  the kinetics of H2 adsorption and desorption on PdCu
                  surfaces are not well understood. In this work, the
                  kinetics and energetics of H2 adsorption and
                  desorption on Pd, Cu, and PdCu surfaces are
                  investigated by microkinetic analysis of H2?D2
                  exchange (H2 + D2 ? 2HD) over fixed beds of Pd, Cu,
                  Pd70Cu30, and Pd47Cu53 foils at near-ambient
                  pressure and temperatures in the range 300?900
                  K. The rate of H2?D2 exchange over Cu, which is the
                  least active H2?D2 exchange catalyst used in this
                  study, is limited by the rate of H2 adsorption due
                  to the large activation barrier to dissociative H2
                  adsorption on Cu (?Eads? = 0.54 ± 0.06 eV). The Cu
                  content of the PdCu alloys and the crystal
                  structures of the Pd-hydride phases (α- and ?-PdH)
                  and of Pd47Cu53 (body-centered cubic and
                  face-centered cubic (FCC)) all have a significant
                  impact on the kinetics of H2?D2 exchange. The
                  activation barriers to dissociative H2 adsorption,
                  ?Eads?, on ?-Pd-hydride (0.3 ± 0.1 eV), α-Pd-hydride
                  (0.12 ± 0.04 eV), Pd70Cu30 (0.09 ± 0.02 eV), B2
                  Pd47Cu53 (0.15 ± 0.02 eV), and FCC Pd47Cu53 (0.00 ±
                  0.02 eV), are relatively small compared to the
                  adsorption barrier on Cu. Over these surfaces, the
                  rates of H2?D2 exchange are limited primarily by the
                  rate of HD desorption. H2?D2 exchange activities in
                  the desorption-limited cases decrease (FCC Pd47Cu53
                  > Pd70Cu30 > B2 Pd47Cu53 > ?-PdH > α-PdH) as the
                  barriers to HD desorption, ?Edes?, increase in the
                  order FCC Pd47Cu53 (0.46 ± 0.03 eV) < Pd70Cu30 (0.52
                  ± 0.02 eV) < ?-PdH (0.63 ± 0.03 eV) < B2 Pd47Cu53
                  (0.67 ± 0.03 eV) < α-PdH (0.68 ± 0.06 eV). These
                  results are significant because they demonstrate
                  that, although the rate of H2 adsorption on pure Cu
                  is very low, Pd can be alloyed with as much as ?50
                  mol \% Cu without significantly reducing its
                  activity for dissociative H2 adsorption.}},

                  permeability. As hydrogen purification membranes,
                  alloys such as Pd70Cu30 and Pd47Cu53 are attractive
                  alternatives to pure Pd due to their resistance to
                  formation of bulk sulfides. Nonetheless, exposure to
                  H2S can decrease the permeability of Pd70Cu30 and
                  Pd47Cu53 membranes, presumably by poisoning the
                  catalytic activity of their surfaces for H2
                  dissociation. In this work, the effect of H2S on H2
                  dissociation on Pd4S, Pd70Cu30, and Pd47Cu53
                  surfaces is investigated by microkinetic analysis of

                  concentrations of H2S at near-ambient H2+D2

                  analysis of the H2-D2 exchange kinetics reveals that
                  H2S decreases the rate of H2-D2 exchange by two
                  distinct mechanisms: (1) increasing the intrinsic

                  characteristic to random solid solutions. Depending
                  on the relative strength of atomic interactions, the
                  occurrence of long-range order (LRO) or short-range
                  order (SRO) can suppress the segregation tendency of
                  an alloy constituent. Since this suppressing effect
                  is weakened with increasing temperature, segregation
                  levels can increase concurrently with entropy-driven
                  compositional disordering. In ordered alloys, such
                  endothermic segregation process should be followed
                  by the well-known monotonously decreasing
                  McLean–Langmuir temperature dependence starting near

                  surface segregation in alloys has been developed and
                  applied to the CuxPd1?x system. A novel
                  offset-filament deposition tool was used to prepare
                  CuxPd1?x composition spread alloy films (CSAFs),
                  high throughput sample libraries with continuous
                  lateral composition variation spanning the range x =
                  0.05?0.95. Spatially resolved low energy ion
                  scattering spectroscopy (LEISS) and X-ray
                  photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to
                  characterize the films? top-surface and near-surface
                  compositions, respectively, as functions of alloy
                  composition, x, and temperature. Electron
                  backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was used to identify
                  the bulk phases in the CSAF as a function of alloy
                  composition, x. Films equilibrated by annealing at
                  temperatures ≥ 700 K displayed preferential
                  segregation of Cu to their top-surfaces at all bulk
                  compositions; segregation patterns did not, however,
                  depend on local structure. The Langmuir?McLean
                  thermodynamic model was applied to segregation
                  measurements made in the temperature range 700?900 K

                  entropy (?Sseg) of segregation as a function of bulk
                  CuxPd1?x composition. Segregation measurements at x
                  = 0.30 on the CSAF compare well with results
                  previously reported for a bulk, polycrystalline
                  Cu0.30Pd0.70 alloy, demonstrating the utility of the

                  structure and total energy have been calculated by

                  perturbation method. They reveal a complex
                  concentration-dependent ordering behavior in these
                  alloys due to band filling and Fermi surface
                  effects. In particular we show that long-period
                  superstructures are gradually stabilized by a great
                  number of relatively weak long-range effective pair-
                  and three-site interactions, which can be seen as ”

                  the surface d-band center upon lattice

  abstract =	 {{Thin PdAg alloy membranes with 20–25\% Ag are being
                  developed for hydrogen separation
                  technology. Despite many investigations on such
                  membranes as well as representative experimental and
                  theoretical model systems, unresolved issues remain
                  concerning the effect of the alloy surface structure
                  and composition on adsorption and vice
                  versa. Therefore, the interaction between hydrogen,
                  carbon monoxide or oxygen with the surface of a PdAg
                  model alloy was studied using periodic
                  self-consistent density functional theory (DFT-GGA)
                  calculations. In particular, the adsorption
                  structure, coverage dependence and possible
                  adsorption-induced segregation phenomena were
                  addressed using Pd3Ag(1 1 1) model surfaces with
                  varying degrees of surface segregation. In agreement
                  with previous experimental and theoretical
                  investigations, we predict Ag surface termination to
                  be energetically favorable in vacuum. The
                  segregation of Ag is then reversed upon adsorption
                  of H, CO or O. For these adsorbates, the binding is
                  strongest on Pd three-fold hollow sites, and hence
                  complete Pd termination is favored at high coverage
                  of H or CO, while 25\% Ag may remain under oxygen
                  because of the lower O-saturation coverage. CO
                  adsorption provides a somewhat stronger driving
                  force for Pd segregation when compared to H, and
                  this may have implications with respect to
                  permeation properties of PdAg alloy surfaces. Our
                  predictions for high coverage are particularly
                  relevant in underlining the importance of
                  segregation phenomena to the hydrogen transport
                  properties of thin PdAg alloy membranes. \^{a}º

  abstract =	 {{We present a comprehensive theoretical and
                  experimental study of the segregation behavior of
                  the ternary alloy CuPdY in vacuum (i.e., the clean
                  surface) and in the presence of oxygen. Theoretical
                  prediction shows that for clean surface, yttrium
                  will substitute first for Cu and then for Pd at the
                  subsurface lattice site before segregating to the
                  surface where it substitutes for Cu. XRD
                  characterization of the surface of CuPdY indicates
                  the presence of two major phases, B2 CuPd and
                  Pd3Y. In the presence of adsorbed oxygen, theory
                  predicts that Y preferentially occupies surface
                  sites due to its stronger oxygen affinity compared
                  to Cu and Pd. XPS experiments confirm the
                  computational results in the adsorbed oxygen case,
                  showing that surface segregation of yttrium is
                  induced by the formation of Y-oxides at the
                  top-surface of the alloy. \^{a}º We study the
                  segregation behavior of CuPdY in vacuum and oxygen

                  a widely used way to compute thermodynamic
                  properties of substitutional alloys. A limitation to
                  their more widespread use is the difficulty of
                  driving a MC simulation in order to obtain the
                  desired quantities. To address this problem, we have
                  devised a variety of high-level algorithms that

                  traditional MC code. The user specifies the goals

                  thermodynamic stability of materials is among the
                  most important steps required to build a ” virtual
                  laboratory,” where materials could be designed from
                  first principles without relying on experimental
                  input. Although the formalism that allows the
                  calculation of solid-state phase diagrams from first
                  principles is well established, its practical
                  implementation remains a tedious process. The
                  development of a fully automated algorithm to
                  perform such calculations serves two
                  purposes. First, it will make this powerful tool
                  available to a large number of researchers. Second,
                  it frees the calculation process from arbitrary
                  parameters, guaranteeing that the results obtained
                  are truly derived from the underlying
                  first-principles calculations. The proposed
                  algorithm formalizes the most difficult step of
                  phase diagram calculations, namely the determination
                  of the ” cluster expanison,” which is a compact
                  representation of the configurational dependence of
                  the alloy's energy. This is traditionally achieved
                  by a fit of the unknown interaction parameters of
                  the cluster expansion to a set of structural
                  energies calculated from first principles. We
                  present a formal statistical basis for the selection
                  of both the interaction parameters to include in the
                  cluster expansion and the structures to use to
                  determine them. The proposed method relies on the
                  concepts of cross-validation and variance
