                  Package for Research in Electronic Structure,
                  Simulation, and Optimization . It is freely
                  available to researchers around the world under the
                  terms of the GNU General Public License. QUANTUM
                  ESPRESSO builds upon newly-restructured
                  electronic-structure codes that have been developed
                  and tested by some of the original authors of novel
                  electronic-structure algorithms and applied in the
                  last twenty years by some of the leading materials
                  modeling groups worldwide. Innovation and efficiency
                  are still its main focus, with special attention
                  paid to massively parallel architectures, and a
                  great effort being devoted to user
                  friendliness. QUANTUM ESPRESSO is evolving towards a
                  distribution of independent and interoperable codes
                  in the spirit of an open-source project, where
                  researchers active in the field of
                  electronic-structure calculations are encouraged to
                  participate in the project by contributing their own

                  several families of perovskite oxides (ABO3) and
                  plausible explanations to their existence are
                  provided in this study through a combination of DFT
                  calculations{,} solid-state physics analyses and
                  simple physical/chemical descriptors. The studied
                  elements at the A site of perovskites comprise
                  rare-earth{,} alkaline-earth and alkaline metals{,}
                  whereas 3d and 5d metals were studied at the B
                  site. We also include ReO3-type compounds{,} which
                  have the same crystal structure of cubic ABO3
                  perovskites except without A-site elements. From the
                  observations we extract the following four
                  conclusions for the perovskites studied in the
                  present paper: for a given cation at the B site{,}
                  (I) perovskites with cations of identical oxidation
                  state at the A site possess close formation
                  energies; and (II) perovskites with cations of
                  different oxidation states at the A site usually
                  have quite different but ordered formation
                  energies. On the other hand{,} for a given A-site
                  cation{,} (III) the formation energies of
                  perovskites vary linearly with respect to the atomic
                  number of the elements at the B site within the same
                  period of the periodic table{,} and the slopes
                  depend systematically on the oxidation state of the
                  A-site cation; and (IV) the trends in formation
                  energies of perovskites with elements from different
                  periods at the B site depend on the oxidation state
                  of A-site cations. Since the energetics of
                  perovskites is shown to be the superposition of the
                  individual contributions of their constituent
                  oxides{,} the trends can be rationalized in terms of
                  A-O and B-O interactions in the ionic crystal. These
                  findings reveal the existence of general systematic
                  trends in the formation energies of perovskites and
                  provide further insight into the role of ion-ion
                  interactions in the properties of ternary
                  compounds."
