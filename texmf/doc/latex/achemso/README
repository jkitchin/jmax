The achemso bundle provides a LaTeX class file and BibTeX style
file in accordance with the requirements of the American
Chemical Society (ACS).  The files can be used for any documents,
but have been carefully designed and tested to be suitable for
submission to ACS journals.

The bundle also includes the natmove package.  This package is
loaded by achemso, and provides automatic moving of superscript
citations after punctuation.

Installation
------------

The package is supplied in dtx format and as a pre-extracted zip
file, achemso.tds.zip. The later is most convenient for most
users: simply unzip this in your local texmf directory and run
texhash to update the database of file locations. If you want to
unpack the dtx yourself, running 'tex achemso.dtx' will extract
the package whereas 'latex achemso.dtx will extract it and also
typeset the documentation.

Typesetting the documentation requires a number of packages in
addition to those needed to use the package. This is mainly
because of the number of demonstration items included in the
text. To compile the documentation without error, you will
need the packages:
 - array
 - booktabs
 - hypdoc
 - listings
 - lmodern
 - mathpazo
 - microtype
