Not Included   
------------
The following packages are required by REVTeX but are not
included in this distribution. Please obtain from CTAN
(Comprehensive TeX Archive Network), e.g. <http://www.ctan.org/>. Direct
links to the necessary files can be found at <http://authors.aps.org/revtex4/>.

natbib.dtx   - Version 8.31a or later; found in latex/contrib/natbib on CTAN
natbib.ins   - LaTeX this to create natbib.sty and natbib
               documentation from natbib.dtx
bm.dtx       - Bold math style - part of (current!) standard LaTeX2e tools
bm.sty       - generated from bm.dtx by running tools.ins
textcase.dtx - Found in latex/contrib/textcase on CTAN
textcase.ins - LaTeX this to generate textcase.sty from textcase.dtx
url.sty      - Found in latex/contrib/misc on CTAN

An up-to-date installation of AMS-LaTeX is also required for certain
documentclass options. Version 2.0 or higher is needed. It is
available from <http://www.ams.org/tex/>.

Recommended styles and packages
--------------------------
With REVTeX implemented as a native LaTeX2e document class, users can 
take advantage of many of the well-supported LaTeX2e packages available.
Here are some that are particularly useful and recommended.

longtable.sty for tables running to multiple pages - part of a
standard LaTeX2e distribution.

hyperref.sty for hyperlinking - should work well with REVTeX 4.1.

graphics.sty and graphicx.sty for figure inclusion - part of LaTeX2e's
standard distribution.

Installation
------------
You already started the installation process by unzipping revtex4-1.zip.
As you will have seen, it created a directory revtex4.1 containing
this file README, the file DOWNLOAD, and the file revtex4-1-tds.zip, which
contains the bulk of the installation.

To install this software into a TDS-compliant TeX installation, like
TeX Live, working as root, issue a shell command like

  unzip revtex4-1-tds.zip -d /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/
  
where the destination for the unzipped files is, in this example, 
appropriate for a local modificaton of a sufficiently recent distribution
of TeX Live. You may of course choose a different destination depending 
on your particular requirements. 

After installation, files will be located as per the Manifest above.

Run the appropriate update command (mktexlsr, initexmf -u, etc.); under
TeX Live that would be (as root)

   mktexlsr /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

Install required packages (AMS-LaTeX, natbib, textcase, and bm). 
Please consult the documentaton for your local TeX package for more information. 
MikTeX users should use a recent version (see http://miktex.org/) and consult
the documentation there. There are several steps you will have to do. Please
note that the steps given here may change with future versions of MikTeX, but
the basic steps should be quite similar.
  1) Create a texmf-local directory if needed. For example, you might create
     a directory such as C:\local\miktex\texmf-local.
  2) Tell MikTeX where your texmf-local directory is. Find the MikTeX Options
     window and look for the "Roots" tab. If your texmf-local directory
     is not listed, click "Add" and add it.
  3) Unzip the revtex4-1-tds.zip (part of the REVTeX distribtution) in your
     texmf-local directory.
  4) Update the "File Name Database (FNDB)." This step is essential and
     it registers all of the files in your texmf-local directory with MikTeX.
     Do this by clicking on "Refresh FNDB" in the General tab of the MikTeX
     Options window.
     
MikTex also comes with a package manager. This can be an easier way to maintain
the packages installed on your system. However, please note that the packages
available may not be the most current version of the packages.

Credits
-------
David Carlisle created the first draft of REVTeX 4; Arthur Ogawa has 
supported the TeX development since. Patrick Daly was so kind as to 
incorporate needed changes into natbib and custom-bib. All worked under 
commission from the APS. Mark Doyle, APS Assistant Director, Journal
Information Systems coordinated the effort, which was partly underwritten
by the American Institute of Physics. The APS is the maintainer of REVTeX,
and all bugs are our responsibility. Please e-mail feedback to revtex@aps.org.

Backwards compatibility
-----------------------
The REVTeX 4.1 class file has been named revtex4-1.cls to distinguish it
from its predecessors. If the class file is copied to revtex4.cls,
files created with earlier versions of REVTeX 4 should still work.

LaTeX2e requirements
--------------------
REVTeX 4 requires: 
LaTeX2e [1996/06/01],
natbib  [2009/11/07]
textcase
